Administration Guide
======================

While Turkle can run out of the box using the Django development web server
and a SQLite database, we recommend using a scalable database and a production
quality WSGI HTTP server. This guide describes the steps of running a prodcution
Turkle site.

Topics:
 * Web server
 * Database
 * Cron
 * Email

## Production Webserver Configuration

### Configuring Static Files

In a production environment, static files should be served by a web
server and not by a Django web application.  In `settings.py`, you
will need to set the STATIC_ROOT directory to the location where you
want to store the static files, e.g.:

``` python
STATIC_ROOT = "/var/www/example.com/static/"
```

You should then run the `collectstatic` management command:

``` shell
$ python manage.py collectstatic
```

which will copy all static files for Turkle into the STATIC_ROOT
directory.

The [Django static files HOWTO](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/static-files/deployment/)
provides more details about how Django handles static files in
production environments.

### Running with Gunicorn

[Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org) is a Python WSGI HTTP server that can
be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Gunicorn can be run from Turkle's base directory using:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 turkle_site.wsgi
```

Common Gunicorn runtime options are available in the
[Running Gunicorn documentation](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/run.html).

The Gunicorn command above serves Turkle's web pages on port 8000 but
not the static files like CSS and JavaScript.  For serious production
uses of Turkle, the best option is to use a proxy server (like Apache
or nginx) to serve the static files. More details on that below.

If you don't want to set up a proxy server, you can use
[Whitenoise](https://pypi.org/project/whitenoise/) to serve the static
files.  Install it using:

```bash
pip install whitenoise
```

and then enable Whitenoise in `turkle_site/settings.py` by adding this line
to the MIDDLEWARE section:

``` python
'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
```

Note that you need to follow the previous instructions on configuring static files
before running with whitenoise.

### Apache as a reverse proxy

To use Apache as the proxy server, enable proxying: `a2enmod proxy_http`.
Then edit the configuration of your site to include the proxy information:

```
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /static/ !
ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5000/
```

Apache will look in its default location for the static directory so you'll need to create
a symbolic link (more convenient) or copy the files (safer).
After starting Gunicorn and restarting Apache with the new configuration, you should
be able to view the site at http://localhost/ or whatever the appropriate host name is.

Instructions for using Gunicorn with nginx are found on its [deploy page](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html).
You will still need to configure nginx to serve the static files as we did with Apache.

## Production Database Configuration

### MySQL

First, you need to install the Python mysqlclient library:

```bash
pip install mysqlclient
```
Note that this requires development headers for MySQL and Python to be installed.
The method for installing these depends on your operating system.

Second, create a database and database user for Turkle. In the examples below,
we are calling the database `turkle` and the user `turkleuser` with the password `password`.
Log into the MySQL client and run the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE turkle CHARACTER SET UTF8;
CREATE USER turkleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON turkle.* TO turkleuser@localhost;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Third, update Turkle's settings to point at this database:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'turkle',
        'USER': 'turkleuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost'
    }
}
```
The last step is running the Turkle install steps (migrate and createsuperuser).

### PostgreSQL

First, you need to install the Python PostgreSQL adapter:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```
Note that this requires development headers for PostgreSQL and Python to be installed.
The method for installing these depends on your operating system.

Second, create a database and database user for Turkle. In the examples below,
we are calling the database `turkle` and the user `turkleuser` with the password `password`.
Log into the psql client and run the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE turkle;
CREATE USER turkleuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER ROLE turkleuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE turkle TO turkleuser;
```

Third, update Turkle's settings to point at this database:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'turkle',
        'USER': 'turkleuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost'
    }
}
```
The last step is running the Turkle install steps (migrate and
createsuperuser) described in the "One-time Configuration Steps"
section above.

## Database Backups

To backup the database, edit the configuration in settings.py for backups.
Then run the command:

```bash
python manage.py dbbackup
```

To restore the database:

```bash
python manage.py dbrestore -i [path to dump file]
```

There is [documentation](https://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commands.html) available on the these commands
including how to automatically compress the dump file or remove old dump files.

You will likely want to add a cron job that dumps the database each hour or day.

```
@hourly /path/to/my/script.sh
```

The script needs to access the python running Turkle:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
cd /path/to/turkle

python manage.py dbbackup -c -z
```

## Cron

Task Assignments have expiration dates. The expired assignments are deleted
when the expire_assignments command is run. This can be done manually through
the administration pages or by running the command:

```bash
python manage.py expire_assignments
```

For production sites, we recommend that you configure a cron job to delete
assignments regularly. The `docker-config/` directory contains a 
`turkle.crontab` file that can be used to periodically run the script 
using cron.  The method for configuring a cron job depends on your 
operating system.

The Turkle Docker containers are configured to use cron to
automatically delete expired Task Assignments.

## Email Configuration

Turkle can send password reset emails if your server is configured to deliver emails.
By default, the links to the password reset page are hidden.
To enable, edit the `turkle_site/settings.py` file and set the variable `TURKLE_EMAIL_ENABLED` to `True`.
Then edit the section directly below to configure connecting to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).

## Logging Configuration

Before running Turkle in a production environment, logging must be configured 
in the `turkle_site_settings.py` file. There is also a sample logging 
configuration in the settings file if an administrator wants to receive emails
if HTTP 500 errors occur.
